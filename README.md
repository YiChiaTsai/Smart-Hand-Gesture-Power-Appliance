Control your household appliance remotely with Smart Hand Gesture

With the emerging IoT development, it is more likely that the imaginary scene of manipulating your household appliances remotely seen in Sci Fi film will be fulfilled in the near future.

In this case, we design and implement Arduino as well as its a variety of sensor components to demonstrate how to control our household appliances remotely.

In our infrastructure, we make use of flex (bend) sensors which are equipped on gloves to proceeding bend sensing. Thereby, when user bends his finger with certain pattern, the Arduino can detect the specific trigger caused by corresponding bending pattern of finger and then generate the signal to transmit to relay part via Bluetooth so that we can control our household appliances with wireless method as expected.


Infrastructure:
-Flex (bend) sensors which are equipped on gloves
-Detect bend sensing trigger signal
-Wireless signal communication between two bluetooths
-Realize the achievement of controlling Smart Home remotely
